     * the non-linear optimization programming with no constraint
     ** multivariable optimization
     *** zeroth order methods
     **** Simplex search method
     Although the name of this method includes the word simplex, it has no
     relationship to the Simplex method of linear programming.
     **** pathern search method
     - a family of derivative-free numerical optimization methods.
   - [ ] try to buy a train ticket to go back home
   - [X] finish reading the optimization book using matlab (chapter 12)
   - [X] modify the ROS velodyne drivers source code to fit our needs.
   - [X] read the source code from CMU that calibration HDL with camera.
   - [X] re-investigate the problem of HDL intrinsic calibration

- [X] try to buy a train ticket to go back home
Failed to get a bed ticket, giving up hopes. Bought a seat ticket instead.
- [X] read the Gauss-Markov model and Gauss-Helmert model related docs.
<Geometric Algebra with Application in Engineering>
Gauss-Markov model adjust the parameter set while Gauss-Helmert model not only
adjust the parameters, but also observed data. Thus, Gauss-Markov model is more
robust than Gauss-Helmert model, especially when the initial guess is far away
from the true values. However, one could possibly obtain a better result after
using Gauss-Markov model to derive a relatively good results, and send them as
initial guess of Gauss-Helmert model.
- [X] Go through the whole calibration procedure from the CMU lcct project.
  + make sure it is working. update its interface to accommodate modern MCCT
    toolbox.
  + try to reuse it's source code to extract point cloud.
- [X] rewrite the intrinsic calibration code to accommodate matrix operation and
  parameter adjustment.

- [ ] Tencent project: let robot select road path center
The local planner still has problem, so the whole system doesn't function
properly. We've decided to build ROS from scratch to see if we could work around
this issue. See the 3rd list.
- [ ] Tencent project: facilities the robot with the ability to receive multiple
  goals.
For the same reason as list item #1, didn't finish.
- [X] Build a ROS Kinetic from scratch on Tencent's TK1, make sure it works as
  expected. Especially the local planner.
- [X] hdl intrinsic calibration: turn raw packets to x,y,z easily
- [ ] hdl intrinsic calibration: manual select plane points
- [ ] hdl intrinsic calibration: ransac choosing plane parameters
- [ ] hdl intrinsic calibration: refine plane parameters with Gauss-Helmert model.
