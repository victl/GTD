* Work
** DONE complete the plane points selection program (matlab)
*** Purpose & principles
- Can efficiently select multiple planes from point clouds
*** Outcome visioning
- Good support for HDL calibration
*** Brainstorming
*** Organizing
*** Identifying next actions
- Manual selected plane points have might have some artifacts, may require a
